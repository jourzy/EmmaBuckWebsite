				<h2>Counselling & coaching</h2>
				<p>I was among the first to train at the University of East London in Personal Consultancy, a framework for integrating counselling and coaching to bring about 
	lasting change. We will work at your pace and use the tools and techniques best suited to you and your needs. If you feel you need more counselling, we will spend more time on that. 
	If you are more drawn to coaching, we can do that too. In reality I find most clients benefit from both approaches at different times during our work together.</p>

				<h2>Humanistic approach</h2>
				<p>Working from a humanistic approach, I incorporate practices from cognitive-behavioural therapy, transactional analysis, solution-focused therapy and coaching. 
	I can offer techniques from psychoanalysis like dream interpretation and free association, and use mindfulness for relaxation and focusing. 
	I pay attention to imagery and metaphor. We might use creative techniques to communicate like drawing, writing or using a sand tray. 
	These are particularly useful if you find it difficult to express your thoughts and feelings by talking alone.</p>

				<h2>Collaboration</h2>
				<p>I work collaboratively with my clients which means we travel your road together to find the answers which are right for you. 
	You are your own best expert. I will not assume, diagnose or direct. 
	I will listen and reflect with a non-judgemental and accepting attitude, and help you to find the answers which are within you and which are unique to you. 
	Sessions are client-led, meaning we work on the material you bring and at your pace. 
	I may make suggestions about particular therapeutic approaches and techniques, but decisions about the direction of therapy will ultimately be taken together.</p>

				<h2>No labels</h2>
				<p>I do not use labels and diagnoses because I believe these can trap people in boxes from which they find it hard to break free. 
	I do not have a preconceived idea of 'normal'. 
	If you already have a diagnosis which you find helpful, that's fine and we can work alongside it but I will not use your label to define you.</p>

				<h2>Communication & confidentiality</h2>
				<p>You will get the most out of our sessions together if you attend regularly and work hard. 
	This means being willing and able to communicate with me, using the methods we find most useful, and to reflect on what you discover.
	All sessions are completely confidential and no information about you will be shared with a third party without prior discussion with you.
	If you think this sounds like a way of working that
